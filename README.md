# Maya-tools

Quick dirty Maya scripts that i create will be dumped here.

To use, just launch it from your Maya script editor, or make a button out of it.


- Mgear skin Helper is a usefull tool i made for myself to help save time when i skin / rig an Mgear character, you can quickly cycle betweem saved poses / add animation to the   arms etc, it is still a work in progress.
